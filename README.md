# Module 1 Challenge

## Overview

This project provides Louise with information about how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. Using the Kickstarter dataset that Louise and others provided, this project helps Louise visualize Kickstarter campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. This report can be provided to Louise to help her decide when to lauch a funding campaign for her new play and what an appropriate fundraising goal should be. 

## Analysis and Challenges

Using the data provided, the fundraising campaign outcomes for plays were analyzed based on both launch dates and funding goals. 

### Analysis
To understand the interaction between the fundraising goals and the success or failure of the fundraising campaigns, the number of successful, failed and cancelled outcomes of each campaign for plays were counted. Then using this information, the percentage of each type (success, failure, cancelled) was computed for selected ranges of fundraising goals in intevals of $5,000, starting with less than $1,000 for small campaigns, and going up fundraising goals to $50,000 or more. This breakdown of goals was designed to help Louise determine a reasonable goal amount for her play's kickstarter campaign. 

### Outcomes Based on Goals
For the analysis of kickstarter campaign outcomes based on the funding goals, the following chart shows the percentages of successful, failed and cancelled plays based on the fundraising goals. 



There are several things to notice in this image:

* None of the theatre campaigns were cancelled in the given data.
* Live plays were not including in this analysis.
* When the fundraising goals were between $1,000 - $4,999 there weren't any failed campaigns
* When the fundraising goals was less than $20,000 there were always more successes than failed campaigns. 
* Then when the fundraising goals were just under $35,000 up to $45,000 more campaigns failed than succeeded. 
* Next, the fundraising goals from $35,000 to just under $45,000 gave more successes than failures but both success and failure were present.
* Finally, fundraising goals of $45,000 or greater failed more often than succeeded, with the goal range of $45,000 to just under $50,000 showing no successes.
* It is not clear from this image why these fundraising goal ranges show such a pattern. There must be some other variable lurking that casued these results.
